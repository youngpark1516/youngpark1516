### 🚀 Projects

#### 🏅 [League of Legends Position Analysis](https://github.com/youngpark1516/League-of-Legends-position-analysis)
*Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn*  
Analyzed match data from professional League of Legends games to explore how **gold distribution and role dynamics** affect player performance.  
Built a classifier to predict **player lane positions** using engineered metrics such as gold share, vision score, and combat efficiency.  
Enhanced baseline Random Forest performance through feature engineering (`goldat15/csat15`, `damagetochampions/gamelength`, champion one-hot encoding), achieving an **F1 score of 0.909**.  
Performed fairness and error analysis to evaluate model consistency across different game contexts.
